# Dynamic JWT Validation Middleware

This is a middleware plugin for [Traefik](https://github.com/containous/traefik) with the following features:
* Validation of JSON Web Tokens in cookies, headers, and/or query string parameters for access control.
* Dynamic lookup of public keys from the well-known JWKS endpoint for whitelisted issuers.
* HTTP redirects for unauthorized and forbidden calls when configured in interactive mode.
* Flexible claim checks, including optional wildcards and Go template interpolation.

## Configuration

1a. Add the plugin to traefik, either in your static traefik config file:
```yaml
experimental:
  plugins:
    jwt:
      moduleName: github.com/Brainnwave/jwt-middleware
      version: v1.0
```
1b. or with command-line options:

```yaml
command:
  ...
  - "--experimental.plugins.jwt.modulename=github.com/Brainnwave/jwt-middleware"
  - "--experimental.plugins.jwt.version=v1.0"
```

2) Configure and activate the plugin as a middleware in your dynamic traefik config:
```yaml
http:
  middlewares:
    secure-api:
      plugin:
        jwt:
          issuers:
            - https://auth.example.com
          require:
            aud: test.example.com
          headerMap:
            X-User-ID: sub
```

3) use the middleware in services via docker-compose labels
```yaml
  labels:
    - "traefik.http.routers.my-service.middlewares=secure-api@file"
```

### Options

The plugin supports the following configuration options.

Name | Description
---- | ----
`issuers` | A list of trusted issuers to fetch JWKs from. Keys will be prefetched from these issuers on startup. If a token contains a `kid` that is not known and the `iss` claim matches one of the `issuers`, a call will be made to refresh the keys in the plugin. Any keys previously fetched from the issuer that are no longer retrieved will be removed from the plugin's cache on each fetch. fnmatch-style wildcards are supported to accommodate some multitenancy scenarios (e.g. `https://*.example.com`). It is not recommended to use wildcard `issuers` unless you understand the implication that any webserver on your domain could be used to spoof a JWK endpoint unless you have full confidence in your DNS security and what is running on all servers within the domain in question. 
`secret` | A shared secret or a fixed public key to use for signature validation. A fixed secret may be used in conjunction with `issuers` to combine dynamic and static keys. This can be useful when transitioning from earlier systems or for machine-to-machine tokens signed with internal keys. Note that if a dynamic key is not matched but a static secret is configured, the static secret will be used as a fallback key. If this secret is not the correct  
`require` | A map of zero or more claims that must be present and match against one or more values. If not claims are specified, all tokens that are validly signed by the trusted issuers or with the shared secret will pass. If more than one claim is specified, each is required (i.e an AND relationship exists for all the specified claims). For each claim, multiple values may be specified and the claim will be valid if any matches (i.e. an OR relations exists for values within a claim). fnmatch-style wildcards are supported for claim values. Go template interpolation is support for access to (full) `URL`, `Host`, `Scheme`, `Path` (including query string).
`headerMap` | A map in the form of Header: claim. Headers will be added (or overwritten) by claim values from the token. If the claim is not present, no action for that value is taken (and any existing header will remain unchanged).
`cookieName` | Name of the cookie to retrieve the token from if present. Default: `Authorization`. If token retrieval from cookies must be disabled for some reason, set to an empty string.  If `forwardAuth` is `false`, the cookie will be removed before forwarding to the backend.
`headerName` | Name of the Header to retrieve the token from if present. Default: `Authorization`. If token retrieval from headers must be disabled for some reason, set to an empty string. Tokens are supported either with or without a `Bearer ` prefix. If `forwardAuth` is `false`, the header will be removed before forwarding to the backend.
`parameterName` | Name of the query string parameter to retrieve the token from if present. Default: disabled. If `forwardAuth` is `false`, the query string parameter will be removed before forwarding to the backend.
`redirectUnauthorized` | URL to redirect Unauthorized (401) claims to instead of returning a 401 status code. This is intended for interactive requests where the user should be redirected to login and then returned to the page that access was attempted to. Go template interpolation may be used to construct a `return_to` parameter for the redirection. See examples and template elements below. 
`redirectForbidden` | URL to redirect Unauthorized (403) claims to instead of returning a 403 status code. As above, this is intended for interactive requests and the same template interpolation applies. This is most useful to redirect a user to explain that they do not have access to the resource, even though they are authenticated. Such pages may, for example, offer explanations of how access may be obtained or may offer to allow the user to try using a different identity. If `redirectUnauthorized` is given but not `redirectForbidden` the URL for `redirectUnauthorized` will be used, rather than returning an HTTP status to an interactive session.
`freshness` | Integeter value in seconds to consider a token as "fresh" based on its `iat` claim, if present. If a token is not within this freshness window, the plugin allows that a user may have recently had new permissions and thus new claims granted since last logging in, and will issue a 401 in place of a 403 (as well as redirecting interactive sessions as if Unauthorized). Once a user as logged in again, their token will be within the freshness window and a definitive 403 can be returned or not. Default 3600 = 1 hour. Set freshness = 0 to disable.
`forwardToken` | Boolean indicating whether the token should be removed from where it is found before passing to backend. Default false. If multiple tokens are present in different locations (e.g. cookie and header), only the token used will be removed. 
`optional` | Validate tokens according to the normal rules but don't require that a token be present. If specific claim requirements are specified in `require` but with `optional` set to `true` and a token is not present, access will be permitted even though the requirements are obviously not met, which may not be what you want or expect. In this case, no headers will be set from claims (as there aren't any). 

The following variables are available in Go template for interpolation:

Name | Description
----|----
`{{.URL}}` | Full request URL including scheme and any query string parameters.
`{{.Scheme}}` | https or http
`{{.Host}}` | Host name only, without scheme, including port if any
`{{.Path}}` | Path and any query string parameters

### Examples

#### Interactive webserver with redirection to login and error pages
```yaml
http:
  middlewares:
    secure-interactive:
      plugin:
        jwt:
          issuers:
            - https://auth.example.com
          require:
            aud: test.example.com
          redirectUnauthorized: "https://example.com/login?return_to={{`{{.URL}}`}}"
          redirectForbidden: "https://example.com/unauthorized"
```

#### Requiring that a token's audience matches the domain being accessed
Example URL: 
```
https://client.example.com/api/data/123
```

Config snippet:
```yaml
require:
  aud: {{.Host}}
```

JWT:
```json
{
  "iss": "auth.example.com",
  "aud": "client.example.com"
}
```
